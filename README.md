# volume
FreeBSD sound helper script

# About:
  A simple helper script for adjusting volume on FreeBSD systems.
There may be an easier way to achieve the same thing. It originated
as an attempt to xbindkeys. I failed to get that to work so I've 
created this to make binding the script to keypresses a little easier.

# Install:
  Place volume file in the /usr/local/bin/
  or any part of your $PATH

# Usage:
  If properly installed, trigger commands as needed. Examples
  
  volume up
  volume down
  volume mute

  These should be self evident as to what they do.
